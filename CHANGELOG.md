# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/), and this project adheres to
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [0.8.0] - 2026-06-16

### Added
- **Confidence score** on every taint finding (0-100), derived from the call path
  (number of hops, sink category, lambdas on the path). Shown in the console and
  written to SARIF as `result.properties.confidence`; low scores are flagged
  "review manually".
- **Diff mode** — `scan --diff <ref>` reports only findings whose trace touches a
  file changed against `<ref>` (via `git diff`), for fast pull-request scans. A
  full scan is still recommended periodically, since matching is by file.

### Changed
- CLI and SARIF tool version strings updated.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-06-16

### Added
- **`config` command** — audits Spring config files (`application*.yml/.yaml/
  .properties`, `bootstrap*`) for insecure settings: hardcoded secrets, disabled
  TLS, Spring Security auto-configuration excluded, over-broad Actuator exposure,
  and the H2 console left enabled.
- **`misconfig` command** — a bytecode scan for insecure Spring patterns:
  `csrf().disable()` / `frameOptions().disable()`, `@CrossOrigin(origins = "*")`,
  `Cookie.setHttpOnly(false)` / `setSecure(false)`, and sensitive data
  (passwords, tokens, card numbers) passed to a logger.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-06-16

### Added
- **Five new vulnerability classes**, each benchmark-verified: JNDI injection
  (CWE-74), XXE (CWE-611), template injection / SSTI (CWE-1336), JPQL injection
  (CWE-89), and log injection (CWE-117).
- **New sources**: file upload (`MultipartFile.getOriginalFilename/getInputStream/
  getContentType`), `@MatrixVariable` and `@RequestPart`, request/session
  attributes, and Spring Batch `ItemReader`. Concrete-call sources from the config
  are now wired into the Tai-e analysis.
- **New sink**: open redirect via Spring MVC `ModelAndView.setViewName`.
- **Taint transfers** for transparent wrappers — `Optional` and
  `CompletableFuture` (`of`/`completedFuture` → wrapper, `get`/`orElse`/`join` →
  out). Transfers gain an optional `type` so an `Object` unwrap survives the cast
  the JVM inserts (`Optional<String>` → `String`).

### Changed
- Framework-internal sinks are filtered out (the logging facade, commons-logging,
  Reactor, Netty, …), so broad sinks like `Logger.info` report only application
  code — no false positives from a library logging the data it received.
- Benchmark grows to 30 cases (27 vulnerable, 3 safe); engine detects **27/27**
  with 0 false positives.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-06-16

### Added
- **Hardcoded-secrets scanner** — `spring-taint secrets <classes>`: a bytecode
  pattern scan (any JDK) for secret-named constants, known key formats (AWS,
  GitHub, Slack, PEM, …), and `@Value` defaults. Reported values are masked.
- **Web dashboard** (`dashboard/`, React + Vite + TypeScript) for exploring SARIF
  reports, including the full source→sink taint flow per finding.
- `--config` is now **merged** onto the built-in rules; `--no-default-config`
  restores replace behavior. The config gains a `transfers` section.

### Changed
- Relicensed to **MIT**. Added CONTRIBUTING, CODE_OF_CONDUCT, SECURITY, and
  GitHub issue/PR templates.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-06-16

### Added
- **Stored / second-order injection.** Data returned by a `@Repository` read method
  (returning `String`) is treated as untrusted, catching cross-request flows (e.g.
  stored XSS saved by one request and rendered by another). Conservative by design.
- A `transfers` section in the taint configuration (Tai-e taint transfers).

### Changed
- Benchmark grows to 20 cases (17 vulnerable, 3 safe); engine detects **17/17** with
  0 false positives.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-06-15

### Added
- Multi-framework sources: JAX-RS / Quarkus (`@QueryParam`, `@PathParam`, …) and
  Micronaut (`@QueryValue`, `@Body`, …), alongside Spring MVC/WebFlux and Kafka.
- Per-rule reference documentation (`docs/rules.md`).

## [0.2.0] - 2026-06-15

### Added
- Sources: `@PathVariable`, `@RequestBody`, `@RequestHeader`.
- Reactive WebFlux / R2DBC SQL injection via `DatabaseClient` (interface sink
  matched through call-site mode).
- A self-contained executable jar with the default config bundled.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-15

### Added
- Initial working release: interprocedural taint analysis for Spring Boot on Tai-e.
- Detects SQL injection (direct, cross-layer, via `@KafkaListener`), reflected and
  conditional-sanitizer XSS, SSRF, SpEL injection, path traversal, command injection,
  and open redirect.
- CLI with SARIF 2.1 output, a Docker-based GitHub Action, and a benchmark with
  documented ground truth.
